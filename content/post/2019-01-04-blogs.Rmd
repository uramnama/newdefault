#Housing Data

This is a review of housing data I pulled from <https://www.kaggle.com/gpandi007/usa-housing-dataset/version/1>

Lets start off by getting a brief summary on the housing data:
```{r sumry}
library(tidyverse)
housing <- read.csv('C:/Users/maruaz/Documents/Projects/R_blogdown_projects/newdefault/newdefault/static/post/housingtest.csv')
housing.filt = housing %>% select(Id:Neighborhood)
summary(housing.filt)

```

#Below you will see a beautiful bar chart
```{r}
ggplot(housing.filt) + geom_col(aes(Neighborhood,LotArea,fill=LotConfig)) + coord_flip()

```

#Files
`r fa('download',fill="red")`
```{r echo = FALSE} 
xfun::embed_file('C:/Users/maruaz/Documents/Projects/R_blogdown_projects/newdefault/newdefault/static/post/housingtest.csv')

```
