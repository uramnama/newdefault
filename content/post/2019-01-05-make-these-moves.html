<p><strong>Esusu is a startup company founded by Abbey Wemimo and Samir Goel.</strong> This app is designed to help people create and manage rotational savings clubs.</p>
<p>This app is really cool because I have first hand experience in this being a first generation Eritrean American. It all stems from communities of immigrants living in America who have leveraged small lending circles as a mechanism to save money.</p>
<p>“When immigrants move to America they continue to participate in this economic system, but there is no data captured or record of this system” said Goel.</p>
